## Usage

In Claude, invoke the skill naturally:

```
Write me a prompt for Cursor to refactor my auth module
```

```
I need a prompt for Claude Code to build a REST API — ask me what you need to know
```

```
Here's a bad prompt I wrote for GPT-4o, fix it: [paste prompt]
```

```

Or explicitly invoke it:

```
/prompt-master

I want to ask Claude Code to build a todo app with React and Supabase
```

## The Problem This Solves

Every AI user burns credits the same way:

> Write vague prompt → get wrong output → re-prompt → get closer → re-prompt again → finally get what you wanted on attempt 4

That's 3 wasted API calls. Multiply by 50 prompts a day. That's real money and real time gone.

### Key Insight

> "The best prompt is not the longest — it's the one where every word is load-bearing."

Most "prompt generators" make prompts longer. This skill makes them sharper.

## How It Works

Prompt Master runs a structured pipeline on every request:

1. **Detects the target tool** — identifies which AI system the prompt is for and routes silently to the right approach
2. **Extracts 9 dimensions of intent** — task, input, output, constraints, context, audience, memory, success criteria, examples
3. **Asks targeted clarifying questions** — max 3 questions if critical info is missing, never more
4. **Routes to the right framework** — selects and applies the correct prompt architecture automatically, never shown to the user
5. **Applies safe techniques only** — role assignment, few-shot examples, XML structure, grounding anchors, memory block as needed
6. **Runs a token efficiency audit** — strips every word that doesn't change the output
7. **Delivers the prompt** — one clean copyable block with a one-line strategy note

## 5 Safe Techniques Applied When Needed

Prompt Master only applies techniques with reliable, bounded effects. Fabrication-prone techniques like Tree of Thought, Graph of Thought, Universal Self-Consistency, and prompt chaining are explicitly excluded.

| Technique | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role Assignment** | Assigns a specific expert identity to calibrate depth and vocabulary |
| **Few-Shot Examples** | Adds 2-5 examples when format consistency matters more than instructions |
| **XML Structural Tags** | Wraps sections in XML for Claude-based tools that parse it reliably |
| **Grounding Anchors** | Adds anti-hallucination rules for factual and citation tasks |
| **Chain of Thought** | Forces step-by-step reasoning for logic tasks — never applied to o1/o3 |

## 35 Credit-Killing Patterns Detected (with Before/After Examples)

### Task Patterns

| # | Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Vague task verb** | "help me with my code" | "Refactor `getUserData()` to use async/await and handle null returns" |
| 2 | **Two tasks in one prompt** | "explain AND rewrite this function" | Split: explain first, rewrite second |
| 3 | **No success criteria** | "make it better" | "Done when function passes existing unit tests and handles null input" |
| 4 | **Over-permissive agent** | "do whatever it takes" | Explicit allowed + forbidden actions list |
| 5 | **Emotional task description** | "it's totally broken, fix everything" | "Throws uncaught TypeError on line 43 when `user` is null" |
| 6 | **Build-the-whole-thing** | "build my entire app" | Break into Prompt 1 (scaffold), Prompt 2 (feature), Prompt 3 (polish) |
| 7 | **Implicit reference** | "now add the other thing we discussed" | Always restate the full task — never reference "the thing we discussed" |

### Context Patterns

| # | Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 8 | **Assumed prior knowledge** | "continue where we left off" | Include Memory Block with all prior decisions |
| 9 | **No project context** | "write a cover letter" | "PM role at B2B fintech, 2yr SWE experience, shipped 3 features as tech lead" |
| 10 | **Forgotten stack** | New prompt contradicts prior tech choice | Always include Memory Block |
| 11 | **Hallucination invite** | "what do experts say about X?" | "Cite only sources you are certain of. If uncertain, say so." |
| 12 | **Undefined audience** | "write something for users" | "Non-technical B2B buyers, no coding knowledge, decision-maker level" |
| 13 | **No mention of prior failures** | (blank) | "I already tried X and it failed because Y. Do not suggest X." |

### Format Patterns

| # | Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 14 | **Missing output format** | "explain this concept" | "3 bullet points, each under 20 words, one-sentence summary at top" |
| 15 | **Implicit length** | "write a summary" | "Write a summary in exactly 3 sentences" |
| 16 | **No role assignment** | (blank) | "You are a senior backend engineer specializing in Node.js and PostgreSQL" |
| 17 | **Vague aesthetic adjectives** | "make it look professional" | "Monochrome palette, 16px base font, 24px line height, no decorative elements" |
| 18 | **No negative prompts (image AI)** | "a portrait of a woman" | Add: "no watermark, no blur, no extra fingers, no distortion, no text" |
| 19 | **Prose prompt for Midjourney** | Full descriptive sentence | "subject, style, mood, lighting, --ar 16:9 --v 6" |

### Scope Patterns

| # | Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 20 | **No scope boundary** | "fix my app" | "Fix only login form validation in `src/auth.js`. Touch nothing else." |
| 21 | **No stack constraints** | "build a React component" | "React 18, TypeScript strict, no external libraries, Tailwind only" |
| 22 | **No stop condition for agents** | "build the whole feature" | Explicit stop conditions + ✅ checkpoint after each step |
| 23 | **No file path for IDE AI** | "update the login function" | "Update `handleLogin()` in `src/pages/Login.tsx` only" |
| 24 | **Wrong template for tool** | GPT-style prose used in Cursor | Adapted to File-Scope Template with path + scope |
| 25 | **Pasting entire codebase** | Full repo context every prompt | Scoped to relevant function and file only |

### Reasoning Patterns

| # | Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 26 | **No CoT for logic task** | "which approach is better?" | "Think through both approaches step by step before recommending" |
| 27 | **Adding CoT to reasoning models** | "think step by step" sent to o1/o3 | Removed — reasoning models think internally, CoT instructions degrade output |
| 28 | **No self-check on complex output** | (nothing) | "Before finishing, verify output against the constraints above" |
| 29 | **Expecting inter-session memory** | "you already know my project" | Always re-provide the Memory Block |
| 30 | **Contradicting prior decisions** | New prompt ignores earlier architecture | Memory Block with all established facts |

### Agentic Patterns

| # | Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 31 | **No starting state** | "build me a REST API" | "Empty Node.js project, Express installed, `src/app.js` exists" |
| 32 | **No target state** | "add authentication" | "`/src/middleware/auth.js` with JWT verify. `POST /login` and `POST /register` in `/src/routes/auth.js`" |
| 33 | **Silent agent** | No progress output | "After each step output: ✅ [what was completed]" |
| 34 | **Unlocked filesystem** | No file restrictions | "Only edit files inside `src/`. Do not touch `package.json`, `.env`, or any config file." |
| 35 | **No human review trigger** | Agent decides everything | "Stop and ask before: deleting any file, adding any dependency, or touching the database schema" |

## Memory Block System

When your conversation has history, Prompt Master automatically extracts prior decisions and prepends a Memory Block so the AI never contradicts earlier work:

```
## Memory (Carry Forward from Previous Context)
- Stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Supabase
- Auth uses JWT stored in httpOnly cookies, not localStorage
- Component naming convention: PascalCase, no default exports
- Design system: Tailwind only, no custom CSS files
- Architecture: no Redux, context API only
```

This solves the #1 cause of wasted re-prompts in long sessions.

## Full Example

### User Input
```
i want to ask cursor to fix the bug in my login page
```

### Prompt Master Asks
```
Two quick things before I write this:
1. What file is the login page in, and what's the buggy function called?
2. What is the bug doing wrong right now?
```

### User Answers
```
it's src/pages/Login.tsx, the handleLogin function.
When login fails it should show an error but the page just goes blank
```

### Generated Prompt

```
File: src/pages/Login.tsx
Function: handleLogin

Current Behavior:
When login credentials are wrong or the server errors,
the page goes blank. No error message is shown.

Desired Change:
After a failed login, display an inline error below the submit button.
401 → "Incorrect email or password"
500+ → "Something went wrong, please try again"
Network error → "Unable to connect, please check your connection"

Scope:
Modify only handleLogin and the JSX error display section.
Do NOT touch: form layout, input validation, styling, loading state.

Constraints:
- No new dependencies
- TypeScript strict — no `any`, no type assertions
- Preserve existing function signature and return type
- Keep current loading state logic untouched

Done When:
- Failed login shows the correct error message below submit
- Successful login still redirects correctly
- Zero new TypeScript errors introduced
```

**🎯 Target:** Cursor · **⚡ Framework:** File-Scope Template · **💰 Tokens:** Light (~195) · **💡 Strategy:** Scoped to one function, do-not-touch list prevents layout breakage, three-case error spec eliminates ambiguity.
